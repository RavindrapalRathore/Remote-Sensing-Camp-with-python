# Remote-Sensing-Camp-with-python
This project analysis the Camp Fire in Northern California in 2018 by utilizing Google Earth Engine's
data set and Python library. It involves importing Landsat imagery and performing a basic NDVI 
(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis. For more information, please refer to the GitHub 
repositories provided below

In this workshop, you will:

learn the basic principles of remote sensing methods in research
have a hands-on session on using Jupyter Notebooks to code in Python
import Landsat imagery using Google Earth Engine's Python library
conduct a basic NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis
While there are no prerequisites to take this workshop, participants are encouraged to come with a Google Earth Engine account, which can be obtained here:
